Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The DefaultPrivateRoute1 and DefaultPrivateRoute2 tables have DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
That means if a resource within the private subnets gets under malicious control, it could communicate with any endpoint on the internet.

# Poor practice 2
The InstanceRolePolicy-C3 for the IAM InstanceRole allows for S3 actions on any resource.
That means the IAM role could be used to access and change content in any S3 bucket in the AWS account.
